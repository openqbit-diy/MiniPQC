What is Mini PQC?

Mini PQC (Mini Post-Quantum Cryptography) is Software that includes the following technological solutions (algorithms) to be able to create PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) as follows (Requires using python).
•	CHACHA20
•	NEWHOPE
•	NTRU
•	SALSA20
•	SPHINCS+ 
•	RAIBOW
•	CODECRYPT

You can use the AES and Hash (Sha512) for encryption and decryption algorithm this can be used this algorithm supports future attacks and is considered one of the PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) - Does not Requires using python, ony install extension and use direct in App Inventor, Kondular, or other system blockly.

The extension AES para string:

com.openqbit.OpenQbitAESFileDecryption.aix


You can use the Hash (Sha512 for Message and File) extension supports future attacks and is considered one of the PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography).

The user's guide are found in the "HandBooks" directory in the following languages ​​(Spanish and English).

Extensions MiniPQC are found in the "Extensions" directory which are described in detail in the user manual.

Programs python for terminal Termux are found in the "python" directory, these programs must be copied in the path: /data/data/com.termux/files/home

Historically speaking, cryptography can be classified into 4 stages: classical, modern, quantum and post-quantum. The first recognized use of cryptography dates to about 4000 years ago, in some non-standard hieroglyphs found in an Egyptian tomb. Classical cryptography, in one form or another, continued to be used as human civilization continued to evolve.
The Second World War marks an important milestone for cryptography. 

In view of the need to protect messages sent to troops, planes and submarines from a distance, great progress was made in both the construction of cryptographic machines.
The next great revolution appeared in the late 1960s with the development of asymmetric cryptography where a publicly known key is used to encrypt messages and another private key to decrypt them.
In the 70's the first ideas related to quantum cryptography were had, highlighting Shor and Grover's algorithms. 

However, it was not until the 80's that the first publications of new protocols were shown that based their security on the principles of quantum mechanics -such as uncertainty or superposition- using lasers to emit information on a photon.
When the algorithms of public-key cryptography begin to be compromised by quantum computation, post-quantum cryptography emerges, which refers to algorithms designed to resist quantum computer attacks. There are several branches that differ in the way they operate, being these: grid-based algorithms, algorithms based on multivariate equations, algorithms based on supersingular isogenic elliptic curves, hash-based algorithms, and code-based algorithms.
From the point of view of the use and performance of this type of algorithms, its execution in systems with ARM architecture basically oriented to mobile phones as they are has been explored: Android, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 

Hence, the background related to this work exhibits works with post-quantum algorithms that could be divided into executions in ARM based devices and Androdi operating system, in specific use devices and post-quantum algorithm works in ARM architecture, which lie in encryption, digital signatures and key agreements, leaving open the possibility of exploring the hash primitive, algorithms such as CHACHA20, NTRU, NEWHOPE, SALSA20, SPHINCS+, RAIBOW and CODECRYPT, focused on integrity service, as well as its behavior in systems with limited resources.
